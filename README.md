## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play

- You have to click on two cards to open them in order to make a comparison between them , If two cards were matched it will change their color to green with some of different animation to let you know that they are matched.
You have to get all cards matched to win and to see your final result

- The stars rating will apply depends on your clicks count , if you opened all the cards and they were matched before 10 clicks you will have the full 3 stars badges

  But if your clicks number is between 10 and 15 you will got 2 stars badges

  And finally if your clicks number reached to 16 and above you will got just 1 star badge that will reflect your current progress level
